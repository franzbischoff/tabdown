```

### usage
```
npm install tabdown
```
```es6
import tabdown from "tabdown"
...
```

### use cases
You can work directly with tree generated by tabdown. This method is useful for expressing trees with homogenous node types.

<br>
You can also use tokens from `tabdown.lexer` as a base context-free grammar for more complex indentation-sensitive grammars.
```
source      -- tabdown.lexer -->
    tokens      -- secondary lexer -->
        tokens      -- secondary parser -->
            secondary AST
```
This method may be more useful for trees with heterogenous node types.
